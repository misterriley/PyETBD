# PyETBD
Translation of McDowell's Evolutionary Theory of Behavior Dynamics from vbscript into python

This translation of vbscript to python has gotten rid of the original GUI due to difficulties in moving GUIs between the two languages. Rather, it is based on JSON files. 
You can find examples of these files in PyETBD/exp_files/. For more detail about the strucutre of these files see [JSON Structure.md](JSON Structure.md).
